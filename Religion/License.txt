*License of CGTextures's Textures.

 CGTextures offers photographs of materials ("Textures") on its website (www.cgtextures.com) for game developers, special effects artists, graphic designers and other professions. No payment or royalties are required to use these Textures. The use of Textures is non-exclusive, royalty free, and you have the right to modify them for the uses permitted under the clause Conditions of Use.
Most Textures on the CGTextures website are photographed by CGTextures. A small part is photographed by third party contributors ("Contributors"). CGTextures has separate agreements with these Contributors in which they grant CGTextures permission to add their Textures to the website. All terms and conditions in this License apply to both groups of Textures.
All Textures and materials remain in ownership of CGTextures or the Contributor and the Textures and materials are licensed to you, not sold.

The license granted for the use of the textures gives you no lawful right to submit, use or otherwise make available the textures in Second Life or otherwise to Linden Research, Inc. Use of the textures in such manner will be an infringement of the intellectual property rights if CGTextures and CGTextures reserves its right to take action to prevent any such infringement.
